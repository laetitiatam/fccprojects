This calculator written in javascript. 

It fulfills the following user stores (from Free Code Camp):

> 1. I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
> 2. User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
> 3. User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
